# NZ-F18-HORNET-COCKPIT-SIMPIT

My adapted design files and tweaks to the OPENHORNET project files. Visit OpenHornet.com and join their Discord for access to their Fusion360 based files.

A couple things to keep in mind.

I am an absolute believer in "the more accurate your modeling the easier it will be to design" by that I mean for example, the WINWing component models.

Step 1 for me is to model the component as best I can with the part in hand. Translating it from a physical item in my hand to a digital rendering in Fusion360. Once modeled, it easy to design everthing else around it.

HOWEVER!!! I AM NOT professionally trained in CAD. I am completely self taught and have been using Fusion nearly daily for about 6 years. I've learned a lot along the way and am still learning. So don't shoot the messenger.

Also, I am extremely driven on my own OPENHORNET SIMPIT project busting ass on it nearly everyday. In my mind, no matter how small the progress, its still progress toward an end state. I don't want to commit a lot of time to editing files per someone's request. You can learn as I have learned.

So I will provide step files and or Fusion360 files only. I will not provide STLs. You will thank me later when you're trying to modify an STL (p.s. its a bitch). Just get Fusion360 up and running for yourself, verify the model will work for you or make what changes you need then export the STL for 3D printing.

(Hint, Fusion360 has a free version under a "Hobbyist" license and there are a metric ton of how to videos on YT to help.)
